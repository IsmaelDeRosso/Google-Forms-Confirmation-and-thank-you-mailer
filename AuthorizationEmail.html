<p>The Google Forms add-on <i><?= addon_title ?></i> is set to run automatically whenever a form is submitted. The add-on was recently updated and it needs you to re-authorize it to run on your behalf.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you re-authorize the add-on. You can accomplish this by opening one of the forms using the add-on and running the add-on through the menu.</p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the add-on is re-authorized.</p>
